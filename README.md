# Data migration project

For this project, the aim is to extract data from several sources and migrate them to one central location. 

The first goal is to produce a system that stores company data in a database so that it can be accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for data sales. 

Secondly, the database will then be queried to get up-to-date metrics for the business. 

Finally, to make the data more readily available, an API will be created whch will be linked to the database which will allow the analytics teams to easily access the data.
